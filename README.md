It's interesting about some Kaggle's datasets.

My data is downloaded from :

## Volcanic Eruptions in the Holocene Period

* Kaggle datasets page: https://www.kaggle.com/smithsonian/volcanic-eruptions

* My Repository link : https://github.com/yichunsung/Kaggle_funny/tree/master/volcano_Kaggle


## Prediction_Movie

* IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset/kernels

* Question:
1.	Given that thousands of movies were produced each year, is there a better way for us to tell the greatness of movie without relying on critics or our own instincts?

2.	Will the number of human faces in movie poster correlate with the movie rating
